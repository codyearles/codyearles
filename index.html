			Hello!<br>
			I'm Cody, this is a website I'm building for myself and my wife, Julia. This is a work in progress, and as always, there is a lot to do here! My intension is to keep the aestetic simple, easy to load on all devices and easy to update. One day I hope to imporve my coding skills to a level matching the websites of some of my favorite Architects (such as <a href="https://www.heatherwick.com/">Heathwick Studios</a> and <a href="https://koichitakada.com/">Koichi Takada</a>).<br>
