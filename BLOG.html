			It’s taken me 13 years to write this blog post. Not because it has anything grand to say but because it doesn’t have anything remarkable to say at all. To give context, I’ve been thinking about beginning and creating content as it is called for, well, 13 years since YouTube became a way to get famous when I was a teenager. I don’t have an interest in being famous, not now. But I may have then, which probably contributed to the anxiety I felt about putting anything I created on the internet. I have been wondering, how do I… Keep up with writing or creating content? Who would like it or pay attention? What if I have to deal with hate or criticism? I could do… I should do… It wouldn’t be hard! But it would be so hard! I think the connection between being seen and creating was too intertwined for me. Too enmeshed for me to recognize that was the block to creation. For years, I have been hammering myself with grief for not implementing the ideas I had in my head. I would have vivid ideas come to me while driving. Every detail is planned out, intricate and actionable. But always was met with so much resistance. I have ruminated on the why of this for a long time… Why wouldn’t I let myself create when I had the space, energy, or time? Was I lazy? Was I bad? Was I going to be stuck in this rut forever - creating in my mind on drives home only to be sucked dry of any energy to actually do? This has been my inner dialogue for the last 13 years - trying to find the inner motivation to just spell out words and create a dialogue with others about what I am considering. There’s nothing grand about what I am thinking, nothing new or unimaginable and I think that has been my great fear. I have nothing amazing to offer you. I can offer you myself, my thoughts, my being, the parts of my life I want to share, and you sitting on the other side of the screen can choose if this aligns for you. If there’s something about what I do or how I am that resonates. That’s what I can offer. Being seen, being famous, doesn’t need to be the center of creation or generation. This is what I am unlearning. So here’s a toast to 13 years of laziness, non-starting, giving up before starting, as I let myself understand the block that held me back in an intimate and gentle way. No bulldozing - lots of shit-talking I will admit - but here I am with a sweetness in my heart to write and trust in my soul of what is to come.
