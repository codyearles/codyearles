Last summer I was in a deep depression. I was circling around the usual question of do I kill myself or nah? When the answer was repeatedly no, I had to find something to do with my day. Often this meant lying in bed crying and letting the sunlight from my bedroom window wipe the tears away. At some point, I‚Äôd eat something, usually drink cold cacao my friend + roommate A would make for me, and walk my puppy around the neighborhood.
<br>
<br>Throughout those long, sad, hot summer days I would ask myself: Why do I feel like this? I asked my brain, my heart, my lungs, my cells and daily only a small inkling of what was wrong would surface. I couldn‚Äôt make sense of those little knowing all by themselves but over time they stiched their nonsensical selves together. By July 4th, I realized that I had rubbed up against a hard chronic trauma I had experienced with my mother.
<br>
<br>My mother, a wendigo woman, love-starved and ferocious is hard to please. Very hard to please. She oscillates between buying your love and sucking you dry of your own self-love. This was a hard cycle to undergo as a kid who unconditionally loves her mother. A few months before the noxious, self-loathing, suicidal cycle I found myself in I had engaged in a not-relationship-relationship love triangle. We weren‚Äôt dating or romantic but there was this overwhelming connection with complex experiences and emotions I and them couldn‚Äôt put together. We never crossed lines, yet in many ways, it felt that we/I did. (Mostly, me, maybe?)
<br>
<br>The three of us, locked into a drunken Thanksgiving night, found our interconnections imploding upon us. Each of us reacting in our sober, angry, sad, hurt ways. Each of us trying to maintain love + kindness for each other.
<br>
<br>I walked away from that feeling the blame, the fault, the anger centered on me and holding myself as central to the problem. We were all to ‚Äúblame‚Äù‚Ä¶ I hate that word blame. It does nothing for no one and pitches fault on a singular point that does not offer to heal but crushing of that singular point. I was the singular point.
<br>
<br>I held the blame + responsibility of our weirdo love triangle, trying to make amends to my friends whom I had hurt but not acknowledging my own pain or hurt in the process. By July 4th, I had discovered that I was holding the energetic responsibility of a relationship between two people that was not mine to carry.
<br>
<br>I discussed this as I walked down the viney dirt path to the James River outlet where they were throwing an Independence day party with my partner C. Among the laughter, sizzling grill, and party music I found myself adrift in the energetic release of this blame. I focused on A + T in a meditative practice of repeating I cannot carry this anymore, I lovingly return this energy to you. Over and over.
<br>
<br>It‚Äôs hard to imagine returning the responsibility of a splintered betrayal back to people as an act of love, and I struggled to believe it was the right thing to do. I lay over a sun-drenched rock in the river and let the dragonflies dance around me. I breathed deeply and let go. Each layer of self-hatred lifting until I felt myself shake loose the energetic fog that had hung on my shoulders since early spring.
<br>
<br>A few days later, I wrote this poem‚Ä¶ for A.
<br>When I used to hold your feelings (a love poem) üå¨‚Å£
‚Å£<br>
<br>I remember when I put you first, cause I didn‚Äôt want to hurt you. I remember when I said sorry so you didn‚Äôt have to. I remember when I held back my needs + wants so you could feel more secure. ‚Å£
‚Å£<br>
<br>I remember when I looked in your eyes and saw I did something wrong. I felt so disappointed in myself.‚Å£
‚Å£<br>
<br>I was sorry I wasn‚Äôt more considerate. ‚Å£
<br>I was sorry I wasn‚Äôt respectful enough. ‚Å£
<br>I was sorry I felt or needed.‚Å£
‚Å£<br>
<br>Even though I put you first.‚Å£
<br>Even though I bit my tongue.‚Å£
<br>Even though I felt underfed. ‚Å£
‚Å£<br>
<br>When I used to hold your feelings for you everything was great. You smiled, you laughed, you cracked jokes. ‚Å£
‚Å£<br>
<br>But your jokes were kinda mean.‚Å£
<br>And you smiled at my weakness.‚Å£
<br>And I held your feelings.‚Å£
<br>And I felt small.‚Å£
<br>so ùò¥ùòÆùò¢ùò≠ùò≠‚Å£
‚Å£<br>
<br>I didn‚Äôt see how strong I was. ‚Å£
<br>I didn‚Äôt see how compassionate I was.‚Å£
<br>I didn‚Äôt see how caring for you was a lesson in loving myself.‚Å£
‚Å£<br>
<br>I held emotions never meant for me. ‚Å£
<br>Because you recognized my capacity, my strength, my heart in ways I did not.‚Å£
‚Å£<br>
<br>And yes, you used my magic and gave me things I could not hold. You were selfish with my heart, my lungs, my breath...‚Å£
‚Å£<br>
<br>But I love you. So now... I let go ‚ú®üôåüèªüåû‚Å£
‚Å£<br>
<br>I take a deep breath‚Å£
<br>Whisper üçÉ ‚Å£
<br>It‚Äôs your turn, to carry you now. ‚Å£
‚Å£<br>

It‚Äôs taken me 13 years to write this blog post. Not because it has anything grand to say but because it doesn‚Äôt have anything remarkable to say at all. To give context, I‚Äôve been thinking about beginning and creating content as it is called for, well, 13 years since YouTube became a way to get famous when I was a teenager. I don‚Äôt have an interest in being famous, not now. But I may have then, which probably contributed to the anxiety I felt about putting anything I created on the internet. I have been wondering, how do I‚Ä¶ Keep up with writing or creating content? Who would like it or pay attention? What if I have to deal with hate or criticism? I could do‚Ä¶ I should do‚Ä¶ It wouldn‚Äôt be hard! But it would be so hard! I think the connection between being seen and creating was too intertwined for me. Too enmeshed for me to recognize that was the block to creation. For years, I have been hammering myself with grief for not implementing the ideas I had in my head. I would have vivid ideas come to me while driving. Every detail is planned out, intricate and actionable. But always was met with so much resistance. I have ruminated on the why of this for a long time‚Ä¶ Why wouldn‚Äôt I let myself create when I had the space, energy, or time? Was I lazy? Was I bad? Was I going to be stuck in this rut forever - creating in my mind on drives home only to be sucked dry of any energy to actually do? This has been my inner dialogue for the last 13 years - trying to find the inner motivation to just spell out words and create a dialogue with others about what I am considering. There‚Äôs nothing grand about what I am thinking, nothing new or unimaginable and I think that has been my great fear. I have nothing amazing to offer you. I can offer you myself, my thoughts, my being, the parts of my life I want to share, and you sitting on the other side of the screen can choose if this aligns for you. If there‚Äôs something about what I do or how I am that resonates. That‚Äôs what I can offer. Being seen, being famous, doesn‚Äôt need to be the center of creation or generation. This is what I am unlearning. So here‚Äôs a toast to 13 years of laziness, non-starting, giving up before starting, as I let myself understand the block that held me back in an intimate and gentle way. No bulldozing - lots of shit-talking I will admit - but here I am with a sweetness in my heart to write and trust in my soul of what is to come.
