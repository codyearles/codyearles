				Finished February 2, 2022

			<p>
				This is a dinning room table I made with help from Jem for our family. We value the idea of having sit down meals toghether, espically since life can seem so fast pace and busy at times. The top is a live edge slab of <a href="https://www.wood-database.com/ambrosia-maple/">Ambrosia Maple</a> ($500), and glass. The legs are made from heavy duty pallets and and screws, and finished using a Japanese wood preservation technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakisugi">Yakisugi (焼杉)</a>, or commonly known as Shou Sugi Ban outside of Japan. The whole peice is coated in two protective layers of Tung Oil.

				Salvage Dresser with Lichtenburg Top

				September 10, 2019
			</h3>
			<p>
				I found this distressed dresser in an alley and I decided i cound fix it up and give it new life! I made the top form a scrap peice of plywood and a machine I built that passes high voltage through a weak electrolyte solutionfor on the surface of wood to get the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichtenberg_figure">Lichtenberg Effect</a>.

				Live Edge Diploma Frame

				September 3, 2019

			<p>
				I decided that Diploma frames were ridiculously expensive, and poorly made to boot. So! Why not make my own! I used scrap pieces of live edge that a local saw mill throws away.
