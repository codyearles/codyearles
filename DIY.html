				Dinning Table
			</h2>
			<h3>
				Finished February 2, 2022
			</h3>
			<p>
				This is a dinning room table I made with help from Jem for our family. We value the idea of having sit down meals toghether, espically since life can seem so fast pace and busy at times. The top is a live edge slab of <a href="https://www.wood-database.com/ambrosia-maple/">Ambrosia Maple</a> ($500), and glass. The legs are made from heavy duty pallets and and screws, and finished using a Japanese wood preservation technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakisugi">Yakisugi (焼杉)</a>, or commonly known as Shou Sugi Ban outside of Japan. The whole peice is coated in two protective layers of Tung Oil.

				I decided it was about time I visited out west. So I took a week off, built a super basic camper in a weekend, and left RVA! I originally planned to go as far as The Great Sand Dunes in Colorado, but ending going a little further to The Grand Canyon in Arizona. It was great, you should go. I didn't document this build very well, here are pictures of the:

			<p>
				I came to the relization after 3 years working at a computer for 8 or so hours a day, that i really don't like sitting! I decided to get an engineering degree because I thought it meant I would get to build things, well turns out there is a lot a computer work accaciated with it. Anyways! Once I realized that, I just got approval from my manager to go buy some stuff and build a standing desk in the shop. I also knew I wanted a glass top so I could side paper and drawings underneath and write to-do lists and notes on the surface. Here are a couple photos:

				I decided that Diploma frames were ridiculously expensive, and poorly made to boot. So! Why not make my own! I used scrap pieces of live edge that a local saw mill throws away.
