I value simplicity. You'll see that in both my business, and this very website. 

I find simplicity leads the path towards beauty.  Think of a fractal, or the repeating patterns found in nature, that to some literally define the word beauty.  Flowers. Seashells.  The soft curves found in certain forms that curate a certain knowing of fine function.  All these things fundamentally boil down to a simple repeatable function.  For example, computers can simulate these repeatable functions found in nature through very simple math sequences, and do so very quickly to generate fractal imagery.  Nature is slow, and I also find that aspect has value (more on that later, in terms of sustainable living).

Here, you have the opportunity to find simple...

Housing 
Food
Activities 
Wellness
Community 

And essentially, "life"

...If you choose to look by engaging yourself.

I offer these things as part of my mission to create the world I want to live in, with others.

I ask everyone here respect each other as overall equals, with individual and experiential strengths and weaknesses.  My only authority to make this demand is by being the organizer of this Company.  Beyond that, I expect each person to peacefully stand up to injustice, praise justice, and advocate for self-governancy and self-sovernty along side each and every other soul and being.  I hope to be a model in this behavior as well, so that others my feel encouraged to behave in their of suit of however they find is most inherently harmonious.

I believe we are all in this life together, and together we all will stand the tallest.  Divided, only the oppressors will stand tall, yet not as tall as if we we all stood together.
