I value simplicity. You'll see that in both my business, and this very website.<br>
<br>
I find simplicity leads the path towards beauty.  Think of a fractal, or the repeating patterns found in nature.  Flowers. Seashells.  The soft curves found in certain forms that curate a certain knowing of fine function.  All these things fundamentally boil down to a simple repeatable function.  Computers can simulate these repeatable functions very quickly, through very simple math sequences.  Nature does the same thing, yet is much slower.  I also find that aspect also has immense value (more on that later, in terms of sustainable living).<br>
<br>
Here, you have the opportunity to find...<br>
<br>
Agriculture<br>
Tourism<br>
Wellness<br>
Family<br>
Wood<br>
<br>
And essentially, "life", as I am to harmonize.
<br>
...If you choose to look by engaging yourself.
<br>
I offer these things as part of my mission to create the world I want to live in with others.
<br>
I ask everyone respect everyone (including yourself) as equals (with individual and experiential strengths and weaknesses).  My only authority is the respect you give me (each and every time we meet).  I plan to model peacefully standing up to injustice, praising justice, and advocating for self-governancy/sovernty.<br>
<br>
I believe we are all in this life together (and together we all will stand the tallest).  Divided we fall (and only the oppressors will stand tall, yet not as tall as if we we all stood together).
